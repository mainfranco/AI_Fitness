Create a database with images of food and train a nueral net to accuractely predict total calories and macronutrients. Input would be the weight of the food and an image. For example, if openAI determines that the food is a cheesburger and can identify the ingredients, providing the weight will give it more relevant information to make a better prediction on calories and macros. It is tedious and time consuming to measure and weigh each ingredient and clients often dont stick with it. This idea may be slightly less accurate but I would prefer clients having a general idea and a generally good model than not tracking any of their food.
